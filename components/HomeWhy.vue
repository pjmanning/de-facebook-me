          Facebook is no doubt one of the greatest creations of the 21st century. It helped connect
          the world and keep us feeling in touch with our loved ones. But it's users best interest
          are NOT in it's DNA. No doubt there are some amazing people with great intentions working
          at FB, but their job is to keep you addicted and to continue to drive metrics even at the
          expense of society (aka <i>reality</i>...the <i>real</i> world...fuckin plants, animals,
          sticks and stones)
