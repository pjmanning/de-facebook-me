          Your best interests have never been a part of Facebook's DNA. They've created some amazing
          tools and helped connect the world online, but it's come at the cost of privacy and social
          cohesion. Their platforms have been tailored to keep users addicted and to drive metrics
          even at the expense of societal problems.

          Your precious life moments and conversations should not be owned by a corporate entity
          profiting from your inputs. You should understand how and why a company is using
          psychological tactics to keep you addicted, enraged, or feeding you specific types of
          content.
