title: Preparing to Take Back Your Data
description: 'prep description'

In this section, we'll discuss how to prepare before deleting / removing your data. If you choose to only _deactivate_ your accounts - your data will still exist on Facebook. However, if you choose to delete your data it will be completely removed from Facebook (hopefully ;)

<h2 id="step1">1. Create a Backup Folder</h2>

We'll create a specific folder to store all our data from each Facebook service.

To start create a main folder called **FBGraveyard**.
Within that folder create 3 folders for each service: **Facebook**, **Instagram**, **WhatsApp**.

Your folder structure should look like this

- Create a FBGraveyard folder
- Create 1 folder for each service
  - Facebook
  - Instagram
  - WhatsApp

<h2 id="step2">2. Create a Contact Spreadsheet</h2>

The next step is to create a spreadsheet to store all of your contact information.

- Go to [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/)
- Create a new empty sheet labeled **FB Contacts**
- Format your document however you see fit (or you can _File_ -> _Make a copy_ [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cJddrmvtLuRM_5L9re0LSLdozALoHvrTngv78A9DlMo/edit?usp=sharing))

<h2 id="step3">3. Create an Email Template</h2>

Before you deactivate/delete your accounts you may want to message your contacts to let them know you're dipping out. How else will they know how to contact you!?

Therefore, we're going to make a little email/phone template to share ways to contact you in the future (if you want). Tailor this to your wants and needs, but here's mine for reference...

```
Hey {contact_name} -

{your_name} here. I'm taking a break and removing my data from
{platform} for now, but if you'd like to keep in touch I'm going
to leave my contact info below.

Email - {your_email}
Phone - {your_phone_number}

All the best :)
{your_name}
```

<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>

- You should have a local folder with 3 subfolders for each Facebook service.
- You should have started a blank spreadsheet for adding contacts into.
- You should have created a short email/message template for sending to friends about leaving FB/Insta/WA.
