<h2 id="step1">1. Create a Backup Folder</h2>

We'll create a specific folder to store all our data from each Facebook service.

To start create a main folder called **FBGraveyard**.
Within that folder create 3 folders for each service: **Facebook**, **Instagram**, **WhatsApp**.

Your folder structure should look like this

- Create a FBGraveyard folder
- Create 1 folder for each service
  - Facebook
  - Instagram
  - WhatsApp

You'll be deactivating your social life.

- 1 you'll likely be happier
- Less FOMO
- Stronger personal relationships (you'll actually call/meet people rather than - like or comment on a post)

<h2 id="step3">3. Create an Email Template</h2>

<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>

- You should have a local folder with 3 subfolders for each Facebook service.
- You should also have started a blank spreadsheet for adding contacts into.
- You should also have created a short email/message template for sending to friends about leaving FB/Insta/WA.
